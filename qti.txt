Quiz title: [Education] Listening Quiz 1
1. How much funding is required for the first phase of the project?
... Dr. Elena: Raj, I’ve reviewed the latest report on Mars colonization. The main issue is sustainability—how do we ensure long-term resource allocation?

     Dr. Raj: Exactly. The plan requires a minimum of £200 million for the first phase, but I think we should allocate 15% of the budget to Earth’s needs.

     Dr. Elena: Wait, that’s not enough. The report says 40% of resources must go to Earth’s infrastructure. Did you misread the percentage?

     Dr. Raj: No, I recalculated. The correct figure is 25%. Also, the funding from private companies is £150 million, so we’re £50 million short.

     Dr. Elena: That’s a problem. We’ll need to negotiate with the government. What’s the deadline for the project?

     Dr. Raj: It’s due in 18 months, but if we don’t secure the funds, it’ll be delayed by at least 6 months.

     Dr. Elena: And the ethical implications? How will we address intergenerational equity?

     Dr. Raj: That’s a big debate. Some argue we should prioritize Earth’s needs, while others say Mars colonization is a long-term investment.

    Ms. Lin: Dr. Elena, Dr. Raj, thank you for the detailed analysis. I’m here to discuss the intergenerational equity aspect.

    Dr. Elena: Of course. The key is balancing current and future needs. How do you propose we allocate resources?

    Ms. Lin: I suggest a 50-50 split between Earth and Mars. But we must also consider the carbon footprint of the mission.

    Dr. Raj: That’s a good point. The current estimate is 12,000 tons of CO₂ emissions. How do we offset that?

    Ms. Lin: We need to invest in renewable energy. The cost is £30 million, but it’s essential for long-term sustainability.

    Dr. Elena: What about the timeline for the project? The initial deadline is 18 months, but delays are likely.

    Ms. Lin: Agreed. If we extend the timeline by 6 months, we can incorporate more sustainable practices. However, the funding gap remains £50 million.

    Dr. Raj: We’ll need to adjust the budget. If we reduce the Mars allocation by 10%, we can cover the £50 million shortfall.

    Ms. Lin: That’s a viable option. But we must also ensure the resource allocation aligns with global priorities.

Quiz title: [Education] Listening Level B1-B2 Quiz 17
1. What was the corrected percentage of schools using the internet in education by 2000?
... Alex: Jamie, I’ve been thinking about the timeline for our presentation. We need to cover the early days of the internet in education, right?

     Jamie: Absolutely. I’ll start with the 1990s. But wait, I think the first major shift happened earlier—maybe the late 1980s?

     Alex: Hmm, I’m not sure. Let me check. Oh, you’re right—1989. But we need to mention the 1994 project. What was its name again?

     Jamie: The World Wide Web Consortium, or W3C. But we should also highlight the 1996 initiative that made online learning accessible.

     Alex: That’s the Learning Management System (LMS) project. I’ll include that. By the way, the university wants us to focus on the 1990s to 2000s.

     Jamie: Agreed. Oh, and the audience will be 50 students. We need to allocate 20 minutes for the 1990s section.

     Alex: Wait, the 1990s section is 20 minutes, and the 2000s is 30 minutes. That’s 50 minutes total. But the total presentation time is 60 minutes. So we have 10 minutes for the introduction and conclusion.

     Jamie: Correct. Also, we need to mention the 1998 study about the internet’s impact on education. What was the percentage of schools using it then?

     Alex: 35%. But I think the number was corrected to 40% later. Let me confirm.

     Jamie: Yes, the 2000 report said 40%. So we should use the updated figure.

    Alex: Jamie, we need to ensure the projector works for the 1990s slides. The university’s lab has a projector, but it’s outdated.

    Jamie: I know. I’ll request a newer one. Oh, and the slides for the 1990s section need to include the 1994 project’s logo.

    Alex: Right. Also, we should mention the 1996 LMS project. Wait, the university mentioned a 10% discount for early registration. Did you confirm that?

    Jamie: Yes, but the deadline is tomorrow. We need to register by 5 PM.

    Alex: Got it. Oh, and the audience includes 10 international students. We should add a slide about cultural considerations in online learning.

    Jamie: Good idea. Also, the 1998 study’s data was corrected. The original figure was 35%, but the updated one is 40%. We need to clarify that.

    Alex: Understood. Let me check the time again. The 1990s section is 20 minutes, the 2000s is 30 minutes, and the conclusion is 10 minutes. That totals 60 minutes.

    Jamie: Perfect. Oh, and the university wants us to mention the 1999 study on interactive tools. What was the percentage of educators using them?

    Alex: 60%, but I think the number was adjusted to 65%. Let me verify.

    Jamie: Yes, the 2001 report said 65%. So we’ll use that.

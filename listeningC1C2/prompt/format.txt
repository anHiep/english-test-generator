You are given an IELTS-style listening quiz (including a full listening script and questions). 
Reformat the quiz exactly according to the rules below. Do not omit, abbreviate, summarize, paraphrase, or alter any content from the original quiz text, including the complete listening script.
In the gender field, if you can extrapolate from the name, choose randomly.
In the context field, give a narration of the listening test (start with "You will listen to a conversation between ...").
In the question_quantity_guidance field, give a guidance on how to answer the questions. You must infer from the answers of the quiz to replace this " no more than three words and/or a number." with actual quantity.
The question_quantity_guidance is used for all ten questions, so infer the quantity correctly from all variants of all questions' answers.
The question_quantity_guidance must only be the quantity of the answers, with no further instruction or text.

You must return the structured quiz content in the following JSON format:

class message(BaseModel):
    gender: Literal['male', 'female']
    name: str
    text: str

class question_stem(BaseModel):
    question: str
    answers: list[str]

class format(BaseModel):
    context: str
    question_quantity_guidance: str
    dialogue_part1: list[message]
    dialogue_part2: list[message]
    questions: list[question_stem]

The original answer not covers all variants of the answer, you should generate all variants of the answer. For example:
- Times: e.g., 9 am, 9 a.m., 9 AM, 09:00, 9:00 a.m.
- Dates: include day/month and month/day forms and ordinal forms and numeric forms where reasonable, e.g., 12 July, 12th July, July 12, 12/07/2025 (DD/MM/YYYY), 07/12/2025 (MM/DD/YYYY), 12 Jul 2025
- Currency / amounts: e.g., $10, 10 dollars, 10 USD, 10
- Units / measurements: e.g., 5 kg, 5 kilograms, 5-kilogram (if context allows)
- Abbreviations / days / common short forms: e.g., Mon, Mon., Monday
- Spelling variants: e.g., centre, center; colour, color
- Hyphenation / capitalization / punctuation variants: e.g., e-mail, email; PhD, Ph.D.
- Synonyms: where the original answer could naturally be expressed by multiple common synonyms (e.g., online, internet), list each separately.

* Each element in the answer list should be independent, each item must be in one element of the list
* If there are any errors in the quiz (for example: missing answers, missing script, ...), you must infer and fix these errors.
* Make sure that this quiz is complete and flawless.
* Also, change all the currency unit in the quiz into dollar.

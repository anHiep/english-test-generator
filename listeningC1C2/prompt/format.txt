You are given an IELTS-style listening quiz (including a full listening script and questions). 
Reformat the quiz exactly according to the rules below. Do not omit, abbreviate, summarize, paraphrase, or alter any content from the original quiz text, including the complete listening script.
In the gender field, if you can extrapolate from the name, choose randomly.

You must return the structured quiz content in the following JSON format:

class message(BaseModel):
    gender: Literal['male', 'female']
    name: str
    text: str

class question_stem(BaseModel):
    question: str
    answers: list[str]

class format(BaseModel):
    dialogue_part1: list[message]
    dialogue_part2: list[message]
    questions: list[question_stem]

The original answer not covers all variants of the answer, you should generate all variants of the answer. For example:
- Times: e.g., 9 am, 9 a.m., 9 AM, 09:00, 9:00 a.m.
- Dates: include day/month and month/day forms and ordinal forms and numeric forms where reasonable, e.g., 12 July, 12th July, July 12, 12/07/2025 (DD/MM/YYYY), 07/12/2025 (MM/DD/YYYY), 12 Jul 2025
- Currency / amounts: e.g., $10, 10 dollars, 10 USD, 10
- Units / measurements: e.g., 5 kg, 5 kilograms, 5-kilogram (if context allows)
- Abbreviations / days / common short forms: e.g., Mon, Mon., Monday
- Spelling variants: e.g., centre, center; colour, color
- Hyphenation / capitalization / punctuation variants: e.g., e-mail, email; PhD, Ph.D.
- Synonyms: where the original answer could naturally be expressed by multiple common synonyms (e.g., online, internet), list each separately.

* Each element in the answer list should be independent, each item must be in one element of the list
* If there are any errors in the quiz (for example: missing answers, missing script, ...), you must infer and fix these errors.
* Make sure that this quiz is complete and flawless.
